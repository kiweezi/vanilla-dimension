# Vanilla Dimension
A datapack to add a redstone dimension to a survival world.

Adds functions to vanilla minecraft to allow a creative testing dimension in a survival world.

Sending the function through a command block will place the player into the creative dimension with no items.
When a returning command is sent, the player is taken to the survival world and all items are given back to them.
